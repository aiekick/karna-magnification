## Windows magnification API for .NET

he Magnification API provides assistive technology vendors with the means for developing screen magnification applications for Windows Vista and later operating systems.The API enables you to display a simple control that magnifies a specified portion of the display by a specified factor. Images as well as text are displayed.
Unfortunately, Microsoft provided only native C++ API functions without .NET equivalent, so I decided to make a simple .NET wrapper in C#.
